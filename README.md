Programs on Data-structure and Algorithm 
Data : The term data comes from its singular form datum, 
which means a fact. 

Data Structure : 
                A data structure in Computer Science, is a way of storing and organizing data in a computerâ€™s memory or even disk storage
so that it can be used efficiently.

! Data Structure is Not a language

To achieve Proper and Systematic arrangement of data.Variety of operations (Insert, delete, search, sort) can be performed using as few resources as possible.Speed up execution and save time and Efficient use of memory space.Data structures are implemented by a programming language by the data types and the references and operations provide by that particular language. 


Types of Data Structure : 

Linear data structure 
A data structure is said to be linear if the elements form a sequence.

For example : Array, Stack, Linked list, Queue 

Non linear data structure 
elements in a nonlinear data structure do not form a sequence. 

For example: Trees and Graphs 

Operations on Data Structure:
The data manipulation within the data structures are performed by means of certain operations. 
1) Inserting 2) Searching 3) Traversing  4) Sorting 5) Deleting
